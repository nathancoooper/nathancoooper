## Introduction
ðŸ‘‹ **Hello!** I am Nathan Cooper (he/him), an 18 year old student in the South of the United Kingdom. I'm currently studying Film, Media, and Photography and am about to go into an Animation degree at university. I have a vague grasp of programming, vocal, and physical languages from my personal studies and I spend the majority of my free time learning Japanese, French, Latin, British Sign Language, and Korean.
